<h1>
  HTMLRes Build Instructions
</h1>

<h2>
  Introduction
</h2>

<p>
  <em>HTMLRes</em> is written in Object Pascal and is targeted at Delphi XE and
  later. The Delphi IDE can be used to modify the source and to perform test
  builds. Final builds should be built using the provided Makefile, but you
  can get away with using the IDE if you don't change any resources.
</p>

<p>
  These notes apply only to source code of releases <strong>after</strong>
  <em>HTMLRes</em> v1.2.0.
</p>

<h2>
  Dependencies
</h2>

<p>
  All third party code required to build <em>HTMLRes</em> is included in the
  source code repository.
</p>

<p>
  You need the Delphi VCL in order to compile this code.
</p>

<h2>
  Build Tools
</h2>

<p>
  The following tools are required to build <em>HTMLRes</em>.
</p>

<h3>
  Delphi
</h3>

<p>
  A copy of Delphi XE or later is required to build the object Pascal code.
</p>

<p>
  The Makefile requires the following command line tools:
</p>

<dl>
  <dt class="spaced">
    <code>DCC32</code>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    The Delphi command line compiler.
  </dd>
  <dt class="spaced">
    <code>BRCC32</code>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    The Borland resource compiler. Used to compile various source
    (<code>.rc</code>) files.
  </dd>
</dl>

<p>
  The following environment variable is associated with these tools and must be defined before you run Make:
</p>

<dl>
  <dt class="spaced">
    <code>DELPHIROOT</code>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Set to the install directory of the version of Delphi being used.
    <code>DCC32</code> and <code>BRCC32</code> are expected to be in the
    <code>Bin</code> sub-directory of <code>DELPHIROOT</code>.
  </dd>
</dl>

<h3>
  Borland MAKE
</h3>

<p>
  This is the make tool that ships with Delphi. You can use any version that
  works.
</p>

<h3>
  DelphiDabbler Version Information Editor (VIEd)
</h3>

<p>
  This tool is used to compile version information (<code>.vi</code>) files
  into intermediate resource source (<code>.rc</code>) files. Version 2.11.2
  or later is required. Version Information Editor can be obtained from
  <a
    href="https://delphidabbler.com/software/vied"
  >https://delphidabbler.com/software/vied</a>.
</p>

<p>
  The program is expected to be on the path unless its install directory is
  specified by the <code>VIEDROOT</code> environment variable.
</p>

<h3>
  Inno Setup
</h3>

<p>
  The Unicode version of Inno Setup v5 (not v6 or later) must be used to
  create <em>HTMLRes</em>' install program. v5.6.1(u) or later (with built in
  ISPP pre-processor) is required. You can get Inno Setup at <a
    href="https://www.innosetup.com/"
  >https://www.innosetup.com/</a>.
</p>

<p>
  The program is expected to be on the path unless its install directory is
  specified by the <code>INNOSETUP</code> environment variable.
</p>

<h3>
  Zip
</h3>

<p>
  This program is used to create <em>HTMLRes</em>' release file.
  You can get a Windows command line version at
  <a
    href="http://stahlforce.com/dev/index.php?tool=zipunzip"
  >http://stahlforce.com/dev/index.php?tool=zipunzip</a>.
</p>

<p>
  The program is expected to be on the path unless its install directory is
  specified by the <code>ZIPROOT</code> environment variable.
</p>

<h2>
  Preparation
</h2>

<h3>
  Configure the environment.
</h3>

<p>
  The first step is to configure the required <code>DELPHIROOT</code>
  environment variable.
</p>

<p>
  Next set any of the optional environment variables that are needed to specify
  the path to any tools that are not on the system path.
</p>

<p>
  You can configure environment variables either by modifying your system
  environment variables or by creating a batch file that you run before
  performing the build.
</p>

<h3>
  Get the Source Code
</h3>

<p>
  If you don't already have it, download the <em>HTMLRes</em> source code from
  the <code><a
    href="https://github.com/delphidabbler/htmlres"
  >delphidabbler/htmlres</a></code> GitHub repository. You can either clone it
  using Git or download a zip file containing the source.
</p>

<h3>
  Configure the Source Tree
</h3>

<p>
  After obtaining the source code you should have the following directory
  structure:
</p>

<pre>./
  |
  +-- Demo                  - demonstration source code &amp; support files
  |
  +-- Docs                  - documentation
  |
  +-- Src                   - source code
      |
      +-- Vendor            - imported 3rd party source code</pre>

<p>
  Git users will also see the usual <code>.git</code> hidden directory. If you
  have done some editing you may also see occasional hidden
  <code>__history</code> folders, depending on which version of Delphi you are
  using.
</p>

<p>
  Before you can get hacking, you need to prepare the source tree. Open a
  command console and navigate into the <code>Src</code> sub-folder. Make sure
  you have set the required environment variables then do:
</p>

<pre class="cmd"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span> Make config</pre>

<p>
  You may need to replace <code>Make</code> with the full path to
  <code>Make</code> if it isn't on the path, or if the <code>Make</code> that
  runs isn't the Borland / CodeGear version. If this is the case try:
</p>

<pre class="cmd"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span> %DELPHIROOT%\Bin\Make config</pre>

<p>
  Once <code>Make config</code> has completed your folder structure should
  have acquired the following new folders:
</p>

<pre>./
  |
  +-- Bin                   - receives object files and .res files
  |
  ...
  |
  +-- Exe                   - receives executable code
  |
  +-- Release               - receives release files
  |
  ...</pre>

<p>
  If the <code>Bin</code>, <code>Exe</code> and <code>Release</code> folders
  already existed they will have been emptied. In addition, <code>Make</code>
  will have created a <code>.cfg</code> file from the <code>.cfg.tplt</code>
  template file in the <code>Src</code> folder. <code>.cfg</code> files are
  needed for DCC32 to run correctly. The <code>.cfg</code> file will be ignored
  by Git.
</p>

<p>
  If you are intending to use the Delphi IDE to compile code, you should also
  do:
</p>

<pre class="cmd"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span> Make resources</pre>

<p>
  This compiles the resource files that the IDE needs to link into compiled
  executables.
</p>

<p>
  You are now ready to build the source.
</p>

<h2>
  Building HTMLRes
</h2>

<p>
  You have several options:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Build the <em>HTMLRes</em> Executable
  </li>
  <li>
    Build the Setup Program.
  </li>
  <li>
    Build the Release Zip File.
  </li>
  <li>
    Build and Release Everything.
  </li>
  <li>
    Clean Up.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Each of these options is described below. All except the last assume that
  <code>Make config</code> has been run.
</p>

<h3>
  Build the HTMLRes Executable
</h3>

<p>
  This is the most common build and is achieved by using the following
  commands:
</p>

<pre class="cmd"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span> Make resources
<span class="prompt">&gt;</span> Make pascal</pre>

<p>
  <code>HTMLRes.exe</code> will be generated and placed in the
  <code>Exe</code> folder.
</p>

<h3>
  Build the Setup Program
</h3>

<p>
  The setup program requires that <code>HTMLRes.exe</code> is present in the
  <code>Exe</code> directory.
</p>

<p>
  Once you have built all the required files you build the setup file by
  doing:
</p>

<pre class="cmd"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span> Make setup</pre>

<p>
  The setup program is named <code>HTMLRes-Setup-x.x.x.exe</code>, where
  x.x.x is the version number extracted from <em>HTMLRes</em>' version
  information. It is placed in the <code>Exe</code> directory.
</p>

<h3>
  Build the Release Zip File
</h3>

<p>
  Once the setup file has been created you can create a zip file containing
  the setup file along with <code>ReadMe.txt</code> from the <code>Docs</code>
  directory. If either file is missing the release fails. Build the release by
  doing:
</p>

<pre class="cmd"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span> Make release</pre>

<p>
  By default the release file is called <code>dd-htmlres.zip</code>. You can
  change this name by defining the <code>RELEASEFILENAME</code> macro or
  enviroment variable. For example, you can name the file
  <code>MyRelease.zip</code> by doing:
</p>

<pre class="cmd"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span> Make -DRELEASEFILENAME=MyRelease release</pre>

<h3>
  Build and Release Everything
</h3>

<p>
  You can do a clean build of everything, and generate the release zip file
  simply by doing:
</p>

<pre class="cmd"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span> Make</pre>

<p>
  without specifying a target. This is the equivalent of:
</p>

<pre class="cmd"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span> Make config
<span class="prompt">&gt;</span> Make resources
<span class="prompt">&gt;</span> Make pascal
<span class="prompt">&gt;</span> Make setup
<span class="prompt">&gt;</span> Make release</pre>

<h3>
  Clean Up
</h3>

<p>
  Various temporary files and directories are created by the IDE. These can be
  deleted by running:
</p>

<pre class="cmd"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span> Make clean</pre>

<p>
  Be warned though that this command removes any <code>__history</code>
  folders that some versions of Delphi use to maintain earlier versions of
  files.
