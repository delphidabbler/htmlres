<h1>
  HTMLRes Build Instructions
</h1>

<h2>
  Introduction
</h2>

<p>
  <em>HTMLRes</em> is written in Object Pascal and is targeted at Delphi
  7. The Delphi IDE can be used to modify the source and to perform test
  builds. Final builds should be built using the provided makefile, but you
  can get away with using the IDE if you don't change any resources.
</p>

<p>
  These notes apply only to source code of releases <strong>after</strong>
  <em>HTMLRes</em> v1.2.0. For any earlier version please see the file named
  <code>ReadMe-Src.txt</code> that will be in either the root directory or the
  <code>Docs</code> sub-directory.
</p>

<h2>
  Dependencies
</h2>

<p>
  All third party code required to build <em>HTMLRes</em> is included in the
  source code repository.
</p>

<p>
  You need the Delphi VCL in order to compile this code.
</p>

<h2>
  Build Tools
</h2>

<p>
  The following tools are required to build <em>HTMLRes</em>.
</p>

<h3>
  Delphi
</h3>

<p>
  A copy of Delphi is required to build the object Pascal code. Delphi 7
  is preferred. Delphi 2005 to  2008 should be able to compile the source.
  Delphi 2009 and later may work, but the code hasn't been written with Delphi
  2009's Unicode support in mind, so there may be problems. Delphis earlier
  than version 7 are likely to fail to compile HTML, but this hasn't been
  tested.
</p>

<p>
  You can use the Delphi IDE to edit the code and test compile it. The
  makefile requires the following command line tools:
</p>

<dl>
  <dt class="spaced">
    <code>DCC32</code>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    The Delphi command line compiler.
  </dd>
  <dt class="spaced">
    <code>BRCC32</code>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    The Borland resource compiler. Used to compile various source
    (<code>.rc</code>) files.
  </dd>
</dl>

<p>
  The following environment variables are associated with these tools:
</p>

<dl>
  <dt class="spaced">
    <code>DELPHIROOT</code> - required unless <code>DELPH7</code> is set.
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Should be set to the install directory of the version of Delphi being
    used. <code>DCC32</code> and <code>BRCC32</code> are expected to be in
    the <code>Bin</code> sub-directory of <code>DELPHIROOT</code>.
  </dd>
  <dt class="spaced">
    <code>DELPHI7</code> - optional
  </dt>
  <dd>
    If you are using Delphi 7 this environment variable should be set
    to the Delphi install directory. When specified <code>DELPHIROOT</code>
    will ignore its own value and use the value of <code>DELPHI7</code>
    instead.
  </dd>
</dl>

<h3>
  Borland MAKE
</h3>

<p>
  This is the make tool that ships with Delphi. You can use any version that
  works.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Note:</strong> The version of MAKE included with Delphi 7 will crash
  with an obscure error message if the <code>PATH</code> environment variable
  contains too many paths. If this is the case then you need to either pare down
  the <code>PATH</code> or use a later version of MAKE.
</p>

<h3>
  DelphiDabbler Version Information Editor (VIEd)
</h3>

<p>
  This tool is used to compile version information (<code>.vi</code>) files
  into intermediate resource source (<code>.rc</code>) files. Version 2.11.2
  or later is required. Version Information Editor can be obtained from
  <a
    href="http://www.delphidabbler.com/software/vied"
  >http://www.delphidabbler.com/software/vied</a>.
</p>

<p>
  The program is expected to be on the path unless its install directory is
  specified by the <code>VIEDROOT</code> environment variable.
</p>

<h3>
  Inno Setup
</h3>

<p>
  The Inno setup command line compiler is used to create <em>HTMLRes</em>'
  install program. Inno Setup v5.5.2 ANSI or later with built in ISPP
  pre-processor is required. You can get Inno Setup at <a
    href="http://www.innosetup.com/"
  >http://www.innosetup.com/</a>.
</p>

<p>
  The program is expected to be on the path unless its install directory is
  specified by the <code>INNOSETUP</code> environment variable.
</p>

<h3>
  Zip
</h3>

<p>
  This program is used to create <em>HTMLRes</em>' release file.
  You can get a Windows command line version at
  <a
    href="http://stahlforce.com/dev/index.php?tool=zipunzip"
  >http://stahlforce.com/dev/index.php?tool=zipunzip</a>.
</p>

<p>
  The program is expected to be on the path unless its install directory is
  specified by the <code>ZIPROOT</code> environment variable.
</p>

<h2>
  Preparation
</h2>

<h3>
  Configure the environment.
</h3>

<p>
  The first step is to configure the required <code>DELPHIROOT</code> or
  <code>DELPHI7ROOT</code> environment variables.
</p>

<p>
  Set any of the optional environment variables that are needed to specify the
  path to any tools that are not on the system path.
</p>

<p>
  You can configure environment variables either by modifying your system
  environment variables or by creating a batch file that you run before
  performing the build.
</p>

<h3>
  Get the Source Code
</h3>

<p>
  If you don't already have it, download the <em>HTMLRes</em> source code.
  How to go about that is explained at
  <a
    href="http://www.delphidabbler.com/software/htmlres/download"
  >http://www.delphidabbler.com/software/htmlres/download</a>. If necessary,
  extract the source code into a folder, preserving the directory structure.
</p>

<h3>
  Configure the Source Tree
</h3>

<p>
  After checking out or downloading and extracting the source code you should
  have the following directory structure:
</p>

<pre>./
  |
  +-- Demo                  - demonstration source code &amp; support files
  |
  +-- Docs                  - documentation
  |
  +-- Src                   - source code
      |
      +-- Vendor            - imported 3rd party source code</pre>

<p>
  If, by chance you also have a <code>Bin</code>, <code>Exe</code> and
  <code>Release</code> directory don't worry - all will become clear. Git users
  will also see the usual <code>.git</code> hidden directory. If you have done #
  some editing you may also see occasional hidden <code>__history</code>
  folders, depending on which version of Delphi you are using.
</p>

<p>
  Before you can get hacking, you need to prepare the code tree. Open a
  command console and navigate into the <code>Src</code> sub-folder. Run any
  script you have created to set the required environment variables then do:
</p>

<pre class="cmd"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span> Make config</pre>

<p>
  You may need to replace <code>Make</code> with the full path to
  <code>Make</code> if it isn't on the path, or if the <code>Make</code> that
  runs isn't the Borland / CodeGear version. If this is the case try:
</p>

<pre class="cmd"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span> %DELPHIROOT%\Bin\Make config</pre>

<p>
  or
</p>

<pre class="cmd"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span> %DELPHI7%\Bin\Make config</pre>

<p>
  depending on which environment variable you have set.
</p>

<p>
  Once <code>Make config</code> has completed your folder structure should
  have acquired the following new folders:
</p>

<pre>./
  |
  +-- Bin                   - receives object files and .res files
  |
  ...
  |
  +-- Exe                   - receives executable code
  |
  +-- Release               - receives release files
  |
  ...</pre>

<p>
  If the <code>Bin</code>, <code>Exe</code> and <code>Release</code> folders
  already existed they will have been emptied. In addition, <code>Make</code>
  will have created <code>.cfg</code> and <code>.dof</code> files from
  templates in the <code>Src</code> folder. <code>.cfg</code> files are needed
  for DCC32 to run correctly and <code>.dof</code> files enable the use of the
  Delphi IDE. These files will be ignored by Git.
</p>

<p>
  If you are intending to use the Delphi IDE to compile code, you should also
  do:
</p>

<pre class="cmd"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span> Make resources</pre>

<p>
  This compiles the resource files that the IDE needs to link into compiled
  executables.
</p>

<p>
  You are now ready to build the source.
</p>

<h2>
  Building HTMLRes
</h2>

<p>
  You have several options:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Build the <em>HTMLRes</em> Executable
  </li>
  <li>
    Build the Setup Program.
  </li>
  <li>
    Build the Release Zip File.
  </li>
  <li>
    Build and Release Everything.
  </li>
  <li>
    Clean Up.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Each of these options is described below. All except the last assume that
  <code>Make config</code> has been run.
</p>

<h3>
  Build the HTMLRes Executable
</h3>

<p>
  This is the most common build and is achieved by using the following
  commands:
</p>

<pre class="cmd"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span> Make resources
<span class="prompt">&gt;</span> Make pascal</pre>

<p>
  <code>HTMLRes.exe</code> will be generated and placed in the
  <code>Exe</code> folder.
</p>

<h3>
  Build the Setup Program
</h3>

<p>
  The setup program requires that <code>HTMLRes.exe</code> is present in the
  <code>Exe</code> directory.
</p>

<p>
  Once you have built all the required files you build the setup file by
  doing:
</p>

<pre class="cmd"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span> Make setup</pre>

<p>
  The setup program is named <code>HTMLRes-Setup-x.x.x.exe</code>, where
  x.x.x is the version number extracted from <em>HTMLRes</em>' version
  information. It is placed in the <code>Exe</code> directory.
</p>

<h3>
  Build the Release Zip File
</h3>

<p>
  Once the setup file has been created you can create a zip file containing
  the setup file along with <code>ReadMe.txt</code> from the <code>Docs</code>
  directory. If either file is missing the release fails. Build the release by
  doing:
</p>

<pre class="cmd"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span> Make release</pre>

<p>
  By default the release file is called <code>dd-htmlres.zip</code>. You can
  change this name by defining the <code>RELEASEFILENAME</code> macro or
  enviroment variable. For example, you can name the file
  <code>MyRelease.zip</code> by doing:
</p>

<pre class="cmd"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span> Make -DRELEASEFILENAME=MyRelease release</pre>

<h3>
  Build and Release Everything
</h3>

<p>
  You can do a clean build of everything, and generate the release zip file
  simply by doing:
</p>

<pre class="cmd"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span> Make</pre>

<p>
  without specifying a target. This is the equivalent of:
</p>

<pre class="cmd"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span> Make config
<span class="prompt">&gt;</span> Make resources
<span class="prompt">&gt;</span> Make pascal
<span class="prompt">&gt;</span> Make setup
<span class="prompt">&gt;</span> Make release</pre>

<h3>
  Clean Up
</h3>

<p>
  Various temporary files and directories are created by the IDE. These can be
  deleted by running:
</p>

<pre class="cmd"><span class="prompt">&gt;</span> Make clean</pre>

<p>
  Be warned though that this command removes any <code>__history</code>
  folders that some versions of Delphi use to maintain earlier versions of
  files.
</p>
